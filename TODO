Feedback from the experts
=========================
Spartez Team: Great game aesthetics. I liked the graphics and how smooth it
looks. For the game design part I was confused initially given I just started
playing in the level, and I thought that, what I later figured out it was the
goal of the level, was actually a trap so I couldn't touch it. Also I thought
the levels were randomly generated until I repeated the same level plenty of
times. There could be some improvements on how the levels are generated because
many times I can simply end the level without any challenge, and making the
creatures go faster maybe not the only mechanics that can make the challenge.
You can add some variety of different monsters that can kill the player. For the
improvements you've made for 0.0.2 is a good general direction, please continue!

BjoÌˆrn Ritzl: This is a good start but I feel more could be done with the
concept. There was no real sense of progression or difficulty curve. I would
like to see increasingly large islands, more and faster enemies as you progress.
As it is now you could end up next to the checkpoint on a small island far into
the game. That kind of scenario should be reserved for earlier levels.
